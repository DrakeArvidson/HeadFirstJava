Be The Compiler

A) The array of books, myBooks, was created, but the books also need to be created
for each spot of the array:
myBooks[0] = new Books();
myBooks[1] = new Books();
myBooks[2] = new Books();

B) The array of Hobbits is length 3, meaning it has indices of 0, 1, 2.  In the while loop, it runs while z < 4, meaning z can be 3.
If it tries to get h[3], this will throw an error.  Instead the while loop should run only as long as z < 3.
Along the same lines, z is incremented at the beginning of the while loop, so we never hit h[0], but this means when z is 2,
it will enter the loop and then increment z to 3 and try accessing h[3], which again will fail.  So incrementing z should happen
after every other line of code in the while loop.

This is what the loop should look like
while (z < 3) {
  ...
  ...if
  ...if
  ...
  z = z + 1;
}
