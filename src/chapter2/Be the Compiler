Be the Compiler:

A) In the class TapeDeckTestDrive it is referencing a variable t, but t was never set to anything.
First would need to set t,
TapeDeck t = new TapeDeck();
Now it would compile and run.  Here is what the output would be:
"tape playing"
"tape recording"

B) In the class DVDPlayerTestDrive it calls a method playDVD(), but that method doesn't exist.
In the class DVDPlayer we can create the method:
void playDVD() {
  System.out.println("DVD playing");
}

Now it can run and the output would be:
"DVD playing"
"DVD recording"
