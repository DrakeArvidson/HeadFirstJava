Who Am I? Chapter 4

A class can have any number of these.
A method can have only one of these.
This can be implicitly promoted.
I prefer my instance variables private.
It really means 'make a copy'.
Only setters should update these.
A method can take many of these.
I return something by definition.
I shouldn't be used with instance variables.
I can have many arguments.
By definition, I take one argument.
These help create encapsulation.
I always fly solo.
