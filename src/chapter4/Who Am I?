Who Am I? Chapter 4

A class can have any number of these.					Instance variable, getter, setter, method
A method can have only one of these.					return
This can be implicitly promoted.						return, argument
I prefer my instance variables private.					encapsulation
It really means 'make a copy'.							pass by value
Only setters should update these.						Instance variables
A method can take many of these.						argument
I return something by definition.						getter
I shouldn't be used with instance variables.			public
I can have many arguments.								method
By definition, I take one argument.						setter
These help create encapsulation.						public private getter setter
I always fly solo.										return
